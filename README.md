# 💫 About Me:
I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University, focusing on subjects like Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Network Analysis, and Algorithms. Alongside , I am working on optimizing data plane performance using DPDK and enhancing system-level performance in telecom and network systems.<br>I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving network performance optimization, system-level programming, and low-latency networking solutions.<br>I’m seeking help with exploring new tools and techniques in computer networking, particularly in areas related to kernel programming and advanced system architecture.<br><br>I’m diving deeper into computer architecture, parallel processing, and advanced algorithms as part of my graduate studies.<br>Ask me about 5G network architecture, system-level programming, or how to optimize network traffic flows using DPDK.<br>
