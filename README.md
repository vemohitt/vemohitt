💡 About Me

I'm a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University, specializing in systems programming, OS internals, and high-performance networking. Currently, I’m developing a Linux network driver for Xilinx FPGA, focusing on efficient data transfer and resource optimization. My broader work includes optimizing data plane performance with DPDK and enhancing real-time network processing.

🚀 What I’m Working On

Network Driver Development: Building a Linux NIC driver for Xilinx FPGA to optimize AXI DMA data transfer and improve CPU efficiency.

Network Performance Optimization: Utilizing DPDK, VPP, and multithreading for low-latency packet processing.

Systems & OS Internals: Delving into kernel programming, memory management, and scheduling for enhanced system performance.
